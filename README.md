# Reinforcement Learning
This repo is for playing with reinforcement learning algorithms. I am either using openai gym or ViZDoom as an environment.

I am trying several environments which includes:
- Mountain Car
    - Implemented simple Q-Learning
- Pacman
    - Implemented DQN with CNN architectures
- Breakout
    - Implemented DQN with experience replay and CNN architecture
    - Implemented DQN with GRU architecture

If you need help in setting up your system (mac only) with these environments, refer this:
- [System Setup]('setup_instructions.md')

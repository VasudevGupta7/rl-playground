# Reinforcement Learning
This repo is for playing with reinforcement learning algorithms. I am either using openai gym or ViZDoom as an environment.


Inorder to install openai gym, run the following command in mac terminal:
- `pip install gym`

Run the below command in order to use atari environments
- `pip install gym[atari]` 


Inorder to install ViZDoom, run following commands in mac terminal:
- `brew install cmake boost sdl2 wget`
- `brew cask install julia`
- `pip install vizdoom`

1st two commands were for installing dependencies for installing ViZDoom

Topics to learnt for this project

Data handling
- 1st part
— Eigen portfolio for finding correlated Assets
— Technical indicators
— BERT for sentiment analysis (as part of fundamental analysis)
— Fourier transforms for extarcting overall trend directions
— Stacked encoder for identifying high level features (for finding new features by computer)
— Arima for stock function approximation (like for denoising stock data and extract new patterns)
— Deep unsupervised learning for anomaly detection in option pricing
- 2nd part
— Statistical checks on data for checking flaws and all
— Creating feature importance using XGBoost
— Create Eigen portfolio (using PCA) for reducing dimensionality of auto encoders features

Framework
— Tensorflow 2.0/ something else

GAN
- MHGAN/ WGAN
— Generator- LSTM
— Discriminator- CNN
- the most difficult part will be setting up hyperparameters
— RL
— Bayesian optimisation

Meeting discussion
- process that explains the prediction of stocks (AI interpretability)
- mimic the human for stock management
- GAN, RL, Replicate GitHub (max 2 months)
- Qlearning (24th April)
- Implement simple Q-learning in python
- Git (24th April)

Doubts
- How we are discretising states in MountainCar problem
- Q update
